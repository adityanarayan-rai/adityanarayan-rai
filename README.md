**Hi there ðŸ˜Š**

I am Aditya Narayan Rai. I am a Master's student of [Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/mds/curriculum), Berlin

- In my Master's program, I am learning about applied Data Science and Public Policy
- I mostly work with **Python and R.** I also have experience coding for the web using **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- Alongside my coursework, I am also working on my Master Thesis titled: **"Forecasting Cycling Volume Measurements: A Cross-city Comparative Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques"** (Note: I will be updating and making the repository public for this soon)
- Along with my studies, I am also working as a Student Researcher with the [Evidence for Climate Solutions](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy/research/evidence-for-climate-solutions/evidence-for-climate-solutions) team at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Here, I am working on two research projects at the intersection of Climate Change, Health, and Behaviour Science.
- Before starting my Master's at Hertie School, I worked at [Central Square Foundation](https://www.centralsquarefoundation.org/) in India as a Project Consultant on a **Randomised Controlled Trial** study in the primary education sector. I also worked as a Research Fellow at the [Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/) and Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement. **You can take a look at my CV [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9aiffjpmyir2k1gigipcq/CV_Aditya_Narayan_Rai_March2025.pdf?rlkey=omwbhkt70hkwc2ijag0jahq6w&st=uul6sx84&dl=0)**
